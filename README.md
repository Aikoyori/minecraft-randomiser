# Minecraft Randomiser

This program randomises every single image, sound, shader, and language file of a resource pack and automatically installs it into your resource pack folder.

The default Minecraft resource pack is included by default. The images, sounds, and other files included in said resource pack are owned and created by Mojang AB and I
take no credit for creating them.

## Usage

To use, simply run `randomiser.py`. Options can be viewed using `randomiser.py -h`

`python3 randomiser.py -h` - Get the program's help and list of options.

`python3 randomiser.py --pack faithful` - Randomises the resource pack from the "faithful" folder.

`python3 randomiser.py --notextures --nosounds --pack faithful` - Randomise everything except the textures and sounds from the resource pack in the "faithful" folder.
