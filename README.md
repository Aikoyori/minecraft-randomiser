# Minecraft Randomiser

This program randomises every single image, sound, shader, and language file of a resource pack and automatically installs it into your resource pack folder.

The default Minecraft resource pack is included by default. The images, sounds, and other files included in said resource pack are owned and created by Mojang AB and I 
take no credit for creating them.

## Usage

To use, simply run `randomiser.py`. To randomise a different resource pack, either replace the files in the `pack` folder, or change the `resourcepack` variable in the 
first line of the `randomiser.py` file to another folder of your choosing.

Please report any bugs you experience, especially on Windows and Mac, as neither have been tested.
